    "[Ed Hawkins](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ed_Hawkins_%28climatologist%29) is a professor of climate science at the University of Reading. He is engaged in science communication conveying climate change in data visualization. He designed the [climate spiral](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate_spiral) as well as the warming stripes.\n",

    "Warming stripes (sometimes referred to as climate stripes, climate timelines or stripe graphics) are data visualization graphics that use a series of coloured stripes chronologically ordered to visually portray long-term temperature trends. Warming stripes reflect a \"minimalist\" tyle, conceived to use colour alone to avoid technical distractions and intuitively convey global warming trends to non-scientists. \n",
