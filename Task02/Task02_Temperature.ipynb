    "**[Ed Hawkins](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ed_Hawkins_%28climatologist%29) is a professor of climate science at the University of Reading**. He is engaged in science communication conveying climate change in data visualization. He designed the [climate spiral](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate_spiral) as well as the [warming stripes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warming_stripes).\n",

    "<blockquote>\n",
    "Warming stripes (sometimes referred to as climate stripes, climate timelines or stripe graphics) are data visualization graphics that use a series of coloured stripes chronologically ordered to visually portray long-term temperature trends. Warming stripes reflect a \"minimalist\" tyle, conceived to use colour alone to avoid technical distractions and intuitively convey global warming trends to non-scientists. \n",

    "Global warming can also be observed on a regional scale. You will investigate the temperature development in the German federal state of North Rhine Westphalia (NRW). You will use the data of the DWD (Deutscher Wetterdienst, GErman Weather Service).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Your task is to create a diagram comparable to the warming strips with data from 12 still active meteorological stations in North Rhine-Westphalia**, which provide long annual temperature time series (at least 50 years of data).\n",
