    "When you set up a solar PV generator it usally consists of a set of modules called array. The normal vector (also just called normal) of the array is the direction vector (unit length) perpendicular on the PV module surface. Usually al modules of an PV module array point in the same direction, i.e. have the same normal vector. These parallel PV module surfaces are summarized as the Plane of Array **POA**. The direction of the POA is the direction of each module.\n",
