1. Assign yourself to a group in Moodle, even if you are working alone.
1. Download (not clone) this repo and **rename the folder according to your moodle group**, e.g. rename `EE_2.06_SciProg_SS2021_Exam_Group_XX` to `EE_2.06_SciProg_SS2021_Exam_Group_Z`, if your moodle group is `Z`. 
1. Create **your own HSRW gitlab repo** from it. It is enough if **one member of the group provides the group repo**. If he or she likes the owner of the repo can invite the other group members to collaborate and to grant push rights to them.
